NieR:Automata has a name filter to prevent profanity in file names. The word list is located
in data001 in the coreban.dat file. It has a .bin for each region which contains a word list
that can be unpacked into a text file.

Unpack_name_blacklist unpacks a word_xx.bin into a txt file with each banned word on a new line.
Repack_name_blacklist repacks a txt file with each banned word on a new line into a bin file.

Requires python3

Sample commands:
    python unpack_name_blacklist.py word_us.bin
    python repack_name_blacklist.py word_us.txt
    
The bin files can be repacked into the coreban.dat file and swapped inside of data001.cpk
effectively allowing any names you choose.
